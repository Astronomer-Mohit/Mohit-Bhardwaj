abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are one of the most intriguing unsolved
  mysteries in astronomy. Although several hundred FRBs have been discovered to
  date, the origins of these powerful millisecond duration radio pulses are
  still a conundrum. One promising way to uncover the true nature of FRBs is by
  identifying their host galaxies, studying their local environments, and
  comparing them with those of the proposed progenitors. In my talk, I will
  report on the host association of the two nearby repeating FRB sources,
  20181030Aand 20200120E with dispersion measures 103.3 pc cm-3 and 87.8 pc
  cm-3, respectively, discovered with the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping
  Experiment (CHIME) telescope. We have identified the most plausible hosts of
  20181030A and 20200120E as NGC 3252 (20 Mpc away) and NGC 3031 (also known as
  M81; 3.6 Mpc), respectively. Due to their proximity, these are very promising
  FRB sources to constrain their engines through multi-wavelength follow-up
  studies. I will discuss the properties of the host galaxies and how these
  localizations can help in solving the mystery of FRBs.
