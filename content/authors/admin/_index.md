Mohit Bhardwaj is a McWilliams postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Physics, Carnegie Mellon University. His research interests include multi-messenger astronomy, RF electronics and communication, and applied statistics. He is a member of the [Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME)](https://chime-experiment.ca/en) where he works on newly discovered astrophysical mystery, [Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_radio_burst).  Within the CHIME/FRB collaboration, he is leading the multi-wavelength follow-up and host association of nearby FRBs. Please read his article below on why local Universe FRBs are awesome!
