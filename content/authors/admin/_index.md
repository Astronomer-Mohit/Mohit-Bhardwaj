I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Physics at IIT Kanpur, where I study fast radio bursts (FRBs), compact objects, and other astrophysical transients. My work combines radio observations, multi-wavelength follow-up, and statistical inference to understand how these extreme phenomena originate and how they can be used to probe their surrounding environments. At IIT Kanpur, I have founded the STARBEAMS group (Stellar Transient Analysis and Radio Burst Exploration And Mapping Squad), which brings together students interested in the physics of transient sky phenomena, radio astronomy instrumentation, and data-driven astrophysics. I enjoy working closely with students and fostering a collaborative and supportive research environment. If you are a prospective student or researcher interested in transient astrophysics, radio astronomy, or astrostatistics, I would be happy to connect and discuss opportunities in my group.
